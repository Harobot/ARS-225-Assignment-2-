**Process explanation**: The pictures were taken through the Pokemon Go app utilizing the AR ( augmented reality) feature, allowing you to take photos of real life with the added Pokemon. This creates the illusion of the Pokemon being physically there. It is placed in one spot on the ground and a 3D form. Utilizing these features, Im able to capture the Pokemon from different angles. 
**Why this collection**: The plan with this data set focused on the contrast between nature and technology and how we can use technology to imitate life. The inspiration for this project was the Tamaguchi page from the black book Anthropocene Beast, where they used digital machines to imitate a pet. This includes feeding, interacting, and sleeping. Essentially, it has the behavior of a natural pet but is made of digital data. Furthermore, I decided to take photos of the Pokemon from different angles because I want the AI to use this data set to generate different positions and poses. 
**Possible outcomes**: As mentioned with the goal, I wanted the end product of this data set to have the AI generate images of existing Pokemon and possible random combinations of colors and forms to create new monsters. Thus, I tried to pick Pokemon that are somewhat different in form, color, and elemental typing while also playing around with points of view similar to the faces examples shown in class.
